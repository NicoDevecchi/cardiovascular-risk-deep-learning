# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction (Deep Learning)

Deep learning project to estimate cardiovascular risk using a public Kaggle dataset. The project focuses on building and evaluating neural network models for binary classification.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using classification metrics. The goal is to explore the performance of deep learning models on structured clinical data and compare their behavior with traditional machine learning approaches.

This project was developed as part of the Data Science and Advanced Analytics diploma at UTN.
